Preprint: Albane Ruaud, Niklas A Pfister, Ruth E Ley, Nicholas D Youngblut. Interpreting tree ensemble machine learning models with endoR. bioRxiv (2022). DOI: [10.1101/2022.01.03.474763](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.474763v1)

-------

Data and analyses aim at supporting the goodness of endoR, our method to interpret tree ensemble models: https://github.com/aruaud/endoR/ (or https://github.com/leylabmpi/endoR/, they are the same).

All data generation and analyses were performed by Albane Ruaud with the help of:
- Niklas Pfister: simulations; 
- Nicholas Youngblut: gene set enrichment analysis.

Please write me (albane.ruaud@tuebingen.mpg.de) to access the raw data from simulations and metagenomes (too big to fit on Git) or to clarify the code :)
